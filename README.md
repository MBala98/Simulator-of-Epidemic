# Simulator-of-Epidemic
Program for simulating how an epidemic can spread through society.

Society is represented as graph. People can get immunity after getting sick and recovering, die or not get sick at all.
There are propabilities for meeting and different types of people have different systems of deciding with which people they want to meet.
The report is writing number of sick(chory), healthy(zdrowi) and immune(uodp) after each day.

PS. Sorry for Polish.
